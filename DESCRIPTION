Title: Open-Source Software for Processing and Editing Heart Rate Data
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Matthew G. Barstead
Maintainer: Matthew G. Barstead <mbarstead@deadreckoning.consulting>
Description: ibiVizEdit allows users to process and edit heart rate data obtained via photoplethysmography (PPG).
    Users can create a interbeat interval (IBI) time-series from their raw PPG files, launch an Rshiny GUI that allows 
    them to visually edit the time-series for artifact, and output meaningful summary statistics for the file overall
    and by task/condition if a timing file is supplied.
