# Overview of IBI VizEdit

IBI VizEdit is a program built using RShiny. It is designed to assist in the manual editing of inter-beat interval files that are derived from photoplethysmogram (PPG) recordings. Unlike the electrocardiogram signal (EKG or ECG), PPG signals are characterized by a slow-moving waveform, which presents a different set of challenges when the true signal becomes contaminated with motion artefacts and other sources of noise. 

Though increasingly popular due to their ease of use, most heart rate editing software that exists to date was designed and optimized for the detection and editing of inter-beat interval files derived from EKG signals. IBI VizEdit provides a new suite of tools for researchers who find themselves working with messy PPG files. 

Please note that IBI VizEdit is beta software. It has not been fully tested, and there are likely numerous bugs and opportunities to optimize code and performance. Any and all feedback is welcome. 

*As of right now, IBI VizEdit is only supported for use on Windows 7/8/10 and Linux (Ubuntu 16.04).*
