`ibiVizEdit` current status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dr-consulting/ibi_VizEdit.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.com/dr-consulting/ibi_VizEdit)

`ibiVizEdit` allows users to process and edit heart rate data obtained via photoplethysmography (PPG). Users can create a interbeat interval (IBI) time-series from their raw PPG files, launch an Rshiny GUI that allows them to visually edit the time-series for artifact, and output meaningful summary statistics for the file overall  and by task/condition if a timing file is supplied.

The application is undergoing a major re-factor for distribution as an `R`-package, including the development of a robust testing suite and continuous integration support. Release announcements and notes will provide additional documentation when `ibiVizEdit` is ready for prime time.
