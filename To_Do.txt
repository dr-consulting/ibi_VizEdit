To Do List: 
Need to split raw and edited IBI files by task
Need to split out raw PPG files by task
Need to add the "messy" section button and be able to "split" output around bad sections
Fix glitch where if there are no edits the program returns an error
Add Date and Editor name to Fields for summary files
Ensure that the third ID field is optional (and change the order so it is last). 
Add a backcasting feature for calculating the first IBI accurately.
Use derivatives instead of max values to identify peaks
May need to consider allowing: warmup, iterations, adapt_delta, & tree_depth to be specified by user
